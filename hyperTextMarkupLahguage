1. The name: HyperText Markup Language — what each word means

Hyper
Simple meaning: “more than” or “connected”.
Child analogy: hyper is like a spider’s web — lots of connections.
Real idea: HTML lets pages connect to other pages, files, places — links are the “web” in the World Wide Web.

Text

Plain meaning: the content (words) we see on a page.
But HTML is not only words — it organizes many types of content (text, images, forms).

Markup

Plain meaning: labels or marks added around content to say “this is a heading”, “this is a picture”, “this is a link”.
Child analogy: like sticking Post-it notes on a book telling someone “this is the title”, “this is a picture”, etc.
Real idea: we don’t change the content — we mark it so browsers know how to show it.

Language
It’s a set of rules and words (tags) we use to mark content so machines (browsers) can understand it.
Short: HTML = a set of tags (marks) that tell a browser how to show and connect page content.
