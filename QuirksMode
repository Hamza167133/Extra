Quirks Mode does not use any specific HTML version (like HTML3, 4, or 5).

Instead, the browser uses its own old, non-standard rules — how old browsers (like Internet Explorer 5) used to show pages.

These rules existed before HTML4 and CSS2 were standardized — so the browser “pretends” to be an old browser to show the page.

👉 In short:

When <!DOCTYPE html> is missing, the browser says:
“Maybe this page was written for very old browsers.”

Then it follows its own old layout logic, not HTML5 or any other version.

✅ So:
Quirks Mode = browser’s old custom rules,
not HTML4, not HTML5 — just old browser behavior.
